# AI Algebra Solver

AI Algebra Solver web app built with React and mathjs. Solves linear and systems of equations (e.g., 2x + 3 = 7, 2x + y = 5, x - y = 1). Deployed on Vercel.

## Problem
Solving math equations by hand is slow and error-prone for students.

## Solution
A web app that solves linear and systems of equations with step-by-step solutions, built with React and mathjs.

## AI Role
Grok (xAI) guided the React code, UI design, and documentation.

## Getting Started
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` to view at http://localhost:3000.
3. Visit https://algebra-solver-vercel.vercel.app for the deployed app.

## Features
- Solves linear equations and systems of equations.
- Shows step-by-step solutions.
- Mobile-responsive design with collapsible green sidebar and purple math text.
- Robust error handling for invalid inputs.

## Examples
- Input: `2*x + 3 = 7` → Answer: x = 2
- Input: `x^2 - 4 = 0` → Answer: x = 2, x = -2
- Input: `2*x + y = 5, x - y = 1` → Answer: x = 2, y = 1
